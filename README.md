# credit-card

This is a simple credit-card payment app UI for making/performing transactions on the web, I juts added my own debit card as the default card of the UI (PS:- I made the card with CSS) i hope to add other credit card designs in the future, so that when a user selects their bank it brings up a card UI that corresponds with their bank.

## Tool-setup

The project has been setup using parcel, and it also a react based project, I would be integrating a payment gateway into the app whereby one can actually perfom a real transaction.
